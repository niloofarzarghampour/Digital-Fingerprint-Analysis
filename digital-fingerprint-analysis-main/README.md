Title: Digital fingerprint analysis


To run the code:
Download and go to our folder using Terminal and run the command :
cmake .
make
Then it will generate five executable file (starter1,main1_simu,main1_rest,main3_simu,main3_rest)
Use command ./name_of_executable_file to run it.

For the starter2, we have a problem to translate .py to .cpp file, so we just keeped the .py file. And we also have a matlab file named Minutiae_extraction.m

When running the code,the result will automatically save in the directory named result.

Some of our programs takes long time to run(main1 restauration which depends on size of dictionary and main3 resutauration takes 6 minutes). So we did not test all the values in our program. We saved all the results generated by different values in the directory named all_result.
